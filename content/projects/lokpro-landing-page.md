  - [E-book Landing Page](https://lokpro-ebook.netlify.app/)

## Overview
- Role: Web Developer Intern
- Problem/Goal: The main goal was to create two separate landing pages for a marketing campaign for @loker.programmer, event and e-book. These pages needed to be visually appealing, responsive, and attract users to register for the event or download the e-book. The design will also need to be consistent with the company's branding materials, including the logo, name, and main color scheme.


### Key Features
- Developed two separate Single Page Applications (SPA) using React.js.
- Implemented a consistent and modern design using Material-UI based on the company's branding materials.
- Included specific sections such as a hero section, event details or e-book description, and a call-to-action (CTA) section.
- Make sure the pages are responsive and optimized for performance and SEO.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Styling: CSS, Material-UI
- Design: Figma
- Deployment: Netlify

## Development Process
My process began with creating design mockups in Figma to establish a design that is aligned with the company's brand. After receiving approval, I then develop the landing pages as Single Page Applications using React.js, which allowed for interactivity in the page. I used Material-UI for styling to ensure a clean and modern user interface, while still allowing customization to match the brand's color scheme and typography. Finally, both of the sites were deployed using Netlify.

## Results
The landing pages were successfully launched and received positive feedback from both the team and users. These pages have increased the user engagement, with around **26.32% more users** registered for the event and downloaded the e-book compared to previous campaigns.
