# Event and E-book Landing Page using React.js

Designed and developed a landing page to enhance user engagement for @loker.programmer event and e-book.

## Overview

Live Website:
- [Event Landing Page](https://lokpro-event.netlify.app/)
- [E-book Landing Page](https://lokpro-ebook.netlify.app/)

@loker.programmer is a media/news company mainly focusing on providing job opportunities and resources for programmers in Indonesia. When I was a Web Developer Intern at @loker.programmer, I was tasked with designing and developing a landing page for an event and an e-book. The goal was to create an engaging and informative page that would attract users and encourage them to participate in the event and download the e-book.

## Development Process

I need to develop two separate landing pages, one for the event and one for the e-book. First, I created the design mockups using Figma, ensuring that both pages had a consistent look and feel with the given branding materials, including the logo, name, and the main color scheme of the company. The design also need to include specific sections given, such as a hero section, event details or e-book description, and the most important part, a call-to-action (CTA) section that encourages users to register for the event or download the e-book.

Then, after the design is approved by my supervisor, I started the project using React.js for the development of these pages and create a Single Page App (SPA), as it is still just a simple landing page, but I wanted to add some dynamic interactivity to the page. I used React components to structure the page, ensuring that each section was modular and reusable. I also used Matrial-UI for the styling and icons, which provided a clean and modern look to the pages while still customizable to match the design needed.

Finally, I deployed both landing pages on Netlify, making them accessible to users. The deployment process was straightforward, and I ensured that both pages were optimized for performance and SEO.

## Results
The landing pages were successfully launched and received positive feedback from both the team and users. The event and e-book have increased user engagement, with around 26.32% more users registered for the event and downloaded the e-book compared to previous campaigns.
